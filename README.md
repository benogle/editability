## Usage


## Local development

### If you already have grunt and bower

Navigate to the root directory of this repo. Then run:

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `grunt`

### Installing grunt

Dont have `grunt`? Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

### Installing bower

Dont have `bower`? Install `bower` globally with `npm install -g bower`.

### WTF is npm?

**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.
